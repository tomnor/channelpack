Installation
************

channelpack requires `numpy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`_, but does not
attempt to install that for you during installation. It's not a huge deal to
install numpy, but maybe not trivial either, and there might be reasons you
prefer to do that yourself.

Get channelpack
===============

channelpack is on pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/channelpack
