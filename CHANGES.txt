**0.6.1 (2020-06-26)**

* Better handling of missing values in text files.

* Bugfix to respect encoding using the contextopen function in
  readtext, d1e26a.

* readtext.py: Don't blindly strip all white space from lines (made
  converters argument have no effect).

**0.6.0 (2020-06-10)**

* The project rewritten completely.

* Python 3 and 2 supported.

* History prior to this release might be erased.

**0.4.0 (2017-08-19)**

* Allow open file objects to be supplied to the ``txtpack`` function,
  not only the file name as a string.

* Some pep8 work done in the core python files.

**0.3.2 (2016-10-29)**

* Bugfix in pullxl.py. An update in xlrd version 1.0.0 on empty cell values made
  this bug evident. Empty cells was reported as empty bytestrings before, now it
  is reported as empty unicode strings as documented. The channelpack bug
  resulted in all values in a "channel" being unicode strings when some should
  be numpy.nan and the rest numbers.

**0.3.1 (2015-05-10)**

* Added a records method to ChannelPack.

**0.3.0 (2015-04-06)**

* The persistent condition strings are written whith python syntax operating on
  numpy arrays. Identifiers use replacement syntax like ``%(<id>)``.

* Removed method ``ch`` from the ChannelPack, superfluous.

* Added ``counter`` method to the ChannelPack.

* Added ``parts`` method to the ChannelPack.

* Change name on method set_samplerate, was set_sample_rate.

* A number of bugfixes.

* Two xldate conversion functions in pullxl.

**0.2.2 (2014-11-04)**

* Important bugfix in pulldbf module. Was forcing types on numpy, biggest float
  was 'f4'. In case of excel kind of dates for example, this is not enough, and
  numbers were lost. The result was repeating equal numbers that should not be
  equal.

* Since forcing types on numpy was deprecated, an issue with missing values in a
  dbf file (nulls) was easy to fix. Now, null values are replaced with numpy
  nan, was (0). Also very important.

**0.2.1 (2014-10-20)**

* xlrd added to install_requires list in setup.py

* Docstring fix in slicelist method. Was wrong.

**0.2.0 (2014-10-19)**

* Support for reading spreadsheet data (xlrd as backend).

* Add method slicelist to channelpack.

**0.1.5 (2014-10-15)**

* Bugfix in function rebase in the ChannelPack class. Was a KeyError.

**0.1.4 (2014-09-22)**

* Corrections in the changes file, (this file). Some changes was stated as
  coming but already implemented, (assumingly with 0.1.2).

* Add some coming changes in this file.

* This version has no changes in code and no distribution. But docs are updated.

**0.1.3 (2014-09-21)**

* Docs made available. Readme updated.
* Update docstring in ChannelPack.load
* Comments in the pulltxt module on possible alternative regex.

**0.1.2 (2014-09-21)**

* Bugfix (hopefully) with the start and stop conditions. Addition in function
  _startstop_bool in datautils module. Start conditions could be "ignored".

* Update append_load method in pack.ChannelPack. Keep data on all files loaded
  in metamulti dict, including the new file.

* Add method rebase in ChannelPack, rebase and align a channel.

**0.1.1 (2014-08-16)**

* Editorials on the README file. Some updates in the setup.py file.

**0.1.0 (2014-08-16)**

* Initial release
